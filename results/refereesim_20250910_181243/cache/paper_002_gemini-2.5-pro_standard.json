The most significant flaw is a direct contradiction within the primary results table (Table 1), which renders the paper's main conclusion of statistical significance completely invalid as presented. The reported p-value does not correspond to the data shown. Due to these fundamental errors, the paper's conclusions are not supported by its own data, and it cannot be accepted for publication in its current form. A thorough re-analysis and correction of the manuscript is required.",

      "explanation": "** A p-value is a probability and can never be exactly zero. Standard scientific reporting practice is to state \"p < 0.001\" when the value is very small, or to report the value to three or four decimal places (e.g., the p-value for z=3.591 is approximately p=0.0003). Reporting \"p=0.000\" is statistically inaccurate and demonstrates a lack of familiarity with reporting conventions.",

While this is close to 80%, reporting it with a decimal place as \"80.4%\" is overly precise and inaccurate. This is a minor issue compared to the others but points to a general lack of rigor.",
