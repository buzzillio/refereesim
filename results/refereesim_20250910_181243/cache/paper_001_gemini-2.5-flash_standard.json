The sum is 812 + 1179 = 1991. This creates a direct contradiction in the reported sample size. The Methods section later clarifies \"We recruited 1991 participants,\" indicating that the 2068 in the abstract is the incorrect figure.",

The participant count changes between the abstract and methods, which is a minor but noticeable error. More critically, the paper repeatedly claims \"significant improvement\" based on a p-value (0.155) that clearly indicates a *non-significant* result, given the stated alpha of 0.05. This incorrect statistical interpretation is present in the Abstract and Conclusion, and even creates an internal contradiction within the Discussion section. This undermines the validity of the paper's central claim and its recommendation for implementation. Additionally, the references appear suspiciously generic, potentially indicating a lack of thorough scholarship or even fabricated citations.",
