While a valid and important business metric, calling it \"effect size\" without further qualification is ambiguous and not standard.

These errors could lead readers to misunderstand the true underlying data and the magnitude of the reported effect. The reporting of the p-value and the ambiguous use of \"effect size\" are less severe but still represent deviations from best practices in scientific reporting.",
