      "quoted_text": "**Explanation:** Reporting a p-value of \"0.000\" is incorrect. P-values should be reported as precise values (e.g., <0.001) rather than rounded to zero. Additionally, the z-test statistic of 3.591 corresponds to a p-value of approximately 0.0003 (two-tailed), which should be reported as p < 0.001.",
      "explanation": "** The sample sizes reported in the Abstract (1825) and Methods (1758) do not match. This inconsistency raises concerns about the accuracy of the data.",

      "quoted_text": "The paper has several notable issues, including statistical reporting errors, data inconsistencies, and methodological ambiguities. The most critical errors are the incorrect reporting of p-values and the discrepancy in sample sizes between the Abstract and Methods sections. These issues undermine the credibility of the findings and should be addressed before publication. The paper also lacks clarity in some areas, such as the randomization method and effect size calculation. Overall, while the study appears to have a sound design, the errors and inconsistencies require correction to ensure reliability and validity.",
