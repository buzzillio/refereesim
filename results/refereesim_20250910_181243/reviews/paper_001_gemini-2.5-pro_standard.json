This is a basic data consistency error that undermines confidence in the reported data.",

While not impossible with random assignment, such a large discrepancy in a study of this size is unusual and warrants explanation. It could suggest a problem with the randomization algorithm or that the experiment was not run for the full duration for both groups equally. The authors should have addressed this imbalance.",
